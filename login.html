            At its launch in 2004, Gmail provided a storage capacity of one
            <span class="bl">gigabyte</span> per user, which was significantly higher than its
            competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15
            gigabytes of storage for free, which is divided among other Google
            services, such as Google Drive, and Google Photos.[3] Users in need
            of more storage can purchase <span class="bl">Google One</span> to increase this 15GB
            limit. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size,
            including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25
            megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files
            from <span class="=bl">Google Drive</span> into the message. Gmail has a search-oriented
            interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum.
            The service is notable among website developers for its early
            adoption of <span class="bl">Ajax.</span>

                In June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had <span class="bl"> 25 million </span>active users globally.[119] In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had <span class="bl">900 million </span>active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices.[120] In February 2016, Google announced that </span class="bl">Gmail </span>had passed 1 billion active users.[121][122] In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users.

            <p style="color: aqua;">In the business sector, Quartz reported in <span class="bl">August 2014</span> that, among 150 companies checked in three major categories in the United States (Fortune 50 largest companies, mid-size tech and media companies, and startup companies from the last Y Combinator incubator class), only one <span class="bl">Fortune 50 company </span>used Gmail – Google itself – while 60% of mid-sized companies and 92% of startup companies were using Gmail.</p>
